This directory contains instructions on how to setup Intersystems Cache in a
Linux machine (Red Hat Enterprise Linux RHEL).

The overall process involves:

0) Create the cache user with the script

        ./createCacheUser.sh

1) Download from Intersystems the file

    cache-2008.2.5.951-lnxrh5x86_64.tar.gz

   put it in the ~/Downloads  directory.

2) Create a ~/tmp directory:    mkdir ~/tmp

3) Enter the ~/tmp directory:   cd    ~/tmp

4) Expand the cache  tar.gz file

    tar -xzf ~/Downloads/cache-2008.2.5.951-lnxrh5x86_64.tar.gz

5) Run the "cinstall" script with sudo:

             sudo ./cinstall

6) It will ask you

         1) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (x64)

7) It will ask:

         Enter instance name <CACHE>:

   it will answer that the directory does not exist,
   and

           Do you want to create it <Yes>?

   Hit ENTER to accept the default


9)  Then it will ask for the installation type

        Select installation type.

        2) Server only - Install Cache server
        3) Custom - Choose components to install

10) It will ask whether to install Unicode.

        Do you want to install Cache Unicode support <No>

    Accept the default "No" option and hit ENTER.


11) Then it asks about the security level

      How restrictive do you want the initial Security settings to be?
      "Minimal" is the least restrictive, "Locked Down" is the most secure.
          1) Minimal
          2) Normal
          3) Locked Down
      Initial Security settings <1>?

   Accept the default "1" option and hit ENTER.


12)  Specify the group that can start and stop the instance:

        What group should be allowed to start and stop
          this instance?

     Answer with

                    root

     and hit ENTER


13) The installer will ask about the license with:

        Cache did not detect a license key
        in directory /opt/cachesys/mgr.
        Do you want to enter a license key <No>?

    Reply with "No" at this point and hit ENTER.


14) The installer will present the summary
    of the options that you have selected and will ask
    for confirmation to proceed with the installation.


      Please review the installation options:
